## DBQ Response

For much of Ancient History, and much of today; Islamic achievements have been very important. Their achievements served as contributions to other civilizations, the western world, and today. The stuff they accomplished for the time is very surprising. First, they greatly advanced science. They mathematicians and astronomers in a period when most of the other world scholars were suffering. Statistics say that their cities had a total population of 300,000 with 37 libraries, and 800 public schools. This was unheard of in other places in Europe. They also advanced the medical field. Ancient texts tell us that they wrote large encyclopedias on their discoveries of medicine and treatments. They also created the original textbook on surgery. They bowered what the Indians knew about math and numbers and expanded upon that. The arabs were the creators of algebra or as they call it “al-jabr”. It was the concept of the place-value system. More great achievements include advances in trigonometry, astronomy, and mapmaking using advanced tools, which resulted in calendars and better maps. They created art of calligraphy and combined various styles of architectures to become unique.



For every what there is a why. The Islamic people’s achievements were mainly caused by their faith and love of Allah.  Mathematicians and astronomers’ job was to calculate the time for prayer and the direction of Mecca. Rulers wanted physicians to treat the Ill. The faith promotes a curiosity about the world and a quest for truth. The art was to reflect the glory of Allah. As a result of many great and important achievements, it has a reverberating impact on society back then and today across the world. For example, the medical books written were translated and used for nearly 500 years for healthcare, and is also the basis of surgery. Whether you like it or not, we are still learning algebra using the same concepts as back then. Astronomical tools helped create the calendar year and art can still be seen today. Look around at buildings and you can see influence of their architecture including domes. In summary, Islamic achievements were great and able to impact the world.
